My code is available on github at:

https://github.com/thomas-schillaci/cs7641assignment4

My code was developped on Java 1.8 environment

My repository contains 9 files:

- State.java which is a utility file
- TicTacToe.java and Blackjack.java that are also utility files but can be launched to play the games from the terminal
- 6 files that are the implementations for each algorithm on both problem, for example QBAgent contains the Q-learning algorithm for blackjack whereas 

QAgent is for tic-tac-toe ; launching these files generate the metrics used for the report
